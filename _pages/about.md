I'm PhD Student at <a href="https://lids.mit.edu/people/faculty-pi">MIT LIDS</a>, advised by <a href="https://azizan.mit.edu/index.html">Prof. Navid Azizan</a>.
My current research interest lies in <strong>quantifying reliability of foundational models </strong> (e.g., LLMs).

I was an AI research engineer at <a href="https://naver-career.gitbook.io/en/teams/clova-cic/ai-lab">NAVER AI Lab & CLOVA</a>.
At NAVER, I developed a <strong> user behavior models </strong> and <strong> recommender systems </strong> using large language models (LLMs) for tens of millions of users.
I also conducted research on large-scale representation learning for <strong> temporal data </strong> (e.g., demand forecasting systems).

I received my M.S. and B.S. degree in Aerospace Engineering and Mathematical Sciences (minor) from <a href="https://lics.kaist.ac.kr">KAIST</a> in 2019 and 2017, respectively, 
under the supervision of <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=v5hGAWMAAAAJ&hl=en">Prof. Han-Lim Choi</a>.
During my masterâ€™s degree, I researched 1) <strong> hierarchical RL </strong> and 2) <strong> deep latent variable models </strong>, aiming to bridge the gap between high-level reasoning and low-level control policies.
